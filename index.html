         <p>Deforestation is a major issues and is causing problems that affect all of us. Deforestation is the action of clearing a wide area of tree. Trees and other plants take in carbon dioxide and turn them into oxygen, this carbon dioxide gets stores in the tree as carbon. Due to deforestation there aren't enough trees to turn the required amount of carbon dioxide into oxygen resulting in global warming rates increasing. That's not all, some people burn the forests down instead of cutting them down which is even worse as it releases the carbon stored in the tree. This carbon gets released as carbon dioxide further increases global warming rates.  Deforestation also leads to animal's habitats being destroyed.
